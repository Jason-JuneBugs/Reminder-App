Although this is a group project you must show evidence of your individual contribution to group work.

All group meeting recording links are added to the `recordings/links.txt` file.

Upload your group's final wireframe screenshot to the `/group-wireframes` directory.

Under the `/individuals` directory please create a new folder for each person in the group. For example `/individuals/Tony`. Then I would put all the evidence of my individual contribution into this directory. This would include

- My individual wireframe screenshot. The pros and cons of the wireframe.
- Which meetings I contributed to and the timestamp of my contribution in those meetings.
